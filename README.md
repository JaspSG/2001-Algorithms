# Guide in using the File #
1. Run the MainProg.java file (requires compliation to a .class file). 
2. MainProg will promopt to enter the search string.
3. Enter the pattern to search for this field.
4. Next, the program will prompt user to enter the file name.
5. Enter the file name in this field, which store the text file to be searched on (ensure that the file is in the same directory of the MainProg.java).
6. After that, user will be able to key in the desired algorithms they want their pattern to be searched on. 

# Files used # 
1. MainProg.java: Main Programme which allow user to specify the pattern and text to search for.
2. BruteForceAlgo.java: Stores the required programming logic for Brute Force Algorithm.
3. KMPAlgo.java: Stores the required programming logic for Brute Force Algorithm.
3. BoyerMoore.java: Stores the required programming logic for Brute Force Algorithm. 
4. newalgo.java: (Extra Algorithm Implemented) Stores the required programming logic for an algorithm that our group implemented / improved on.
5. test.fna and graph.fna: Stores the test files.
